\section{Numbers}

\subsection{Negatives}
\begin{definition}[Negative]
The \emph{negative} of a number is its \emph{opposite}, and has the same distance from zero on the number line.  The opposite of \(58\) is \(-58\).  The opposite of \(-27.3\) is \(27.3\).  
\end{definition}

While not the same as subtraction, negative numbers can be viewed as positive numbers being subtracted from \(0\), an idea that will be useful when we start to perform arithmetic with negative numbers.  

\subsubsection{Adding and Subtracting} 
Adding a positive number is equivalent to moving ``right'' or ``up'' the number line.  
Draw a number line diagram for each of the operations below. 
\[10 + 2 = 12  \]
%\[80+19 = 99   \]
\[ 108 + 15 = 123  \]
%\[  -8 + 3 = -5 \]
\[  -15 + 5 = -10   \]
%\[  -8 + 20 = 12 \]
Note that even when starting with a negative, adding a positive number still moves ``up''. 

Subtracting a positive number is equivalent to moving ``left'' or ``down'' the number line. 
Draw a number line diagram for each of the operations below. 
\[ 38 - 11 = 27 \]
\[  5-8 = -3  \]
\[  -7 - 4 = -11   \]
Adding a negative can be translated to subtraction.  For example, 
\[10 + (-2) = 10 -2 = 8 \]
\[  17 + (-8) = 9 \]
Subtracting a negative can be translated to addition.  For example, 
\[  22 - (-4) = 26 \]
\[ -7 - (-2) = -5 \]

\subsubsection{Multiplying and Dividing} 
There are four cases to consider: 
\[ (+)(+) \to (+)  \]
\[ (+)(-) \to (-)  \]
\[ (-)(+) \to (-)  \]
\[ (-)(-) \to (+)  \]
Justify each of these cases for multiplication.  The same justifications will hold for division.

\subsection{Factors}
\begin{definition}[Factor]
The \emph{factors} of any number \(n\) are the numbers that can be multiplied to get \(n\).  

For example, the factors of \(8\) are \(1, 2, 4, \text{ and } 8\). When we say ``factors'', we are usually referring to positive whole-number factors. 
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
	Figure~\ref{fig:number-factors} depicts factoring diagrams of numbers \(1\) through \(6\).  
	Make the factoring diagrams for numbers up through at least \(18\).

	\\ \hspace*{15mm}(b) What do you wonder? 
\end{exercise}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage 
Observing our factoring diagrams in Figure~\ref{fig:number-factors}, some numbers can only be diagramed in two ways.  For example, \(7\) can only be written as \(1 \times 7\) and \(7 \times 1\).  In other words, the only factors of \(7\) are \(1\) and \(7\) itself.  We call such numbers \emph{prime numbers}.  Numbers that have additional number factors are called \emph{composite numbers}.   
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exercise}
	Primes
	\\ \hspace*{15mm} (a) Write down as many primes as you can in 1 minute!
	\\ \hspace*{15mm} (b) Write down three questions about prime numbers. 
	\label{ex:primelist}
\end{exercise}
\vspace{5mm}
We (humanity) know a lot about primes. 
As much as we know, there is much more that we do not know!  There are many \emph{open problems} regarding primes.  The Riemann hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, is related to the distribution of prime numbers.  When moving along the number line, there is no known efficient method for predicting how many numbers will pass before the next prime.  If you were to find such a pattern, you would be instantly famous!  
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exercise} \textbf{Factors: Looking for Patterns in Primes}
\\ \\
(a) Create a list of factors for the numbers up to at least \(20\), and keep count of the number of factors.  
\[ 
	\begin{array}{c | l | c}
		n & \text{Factors} & \text{Count} \\ \hline 		 
		1 & 1  & 1\\ 
		2 & 1, 2 & 2\\ 
		3 & 1, 3 & 2\\ 
		4 & 1, 2, 4 & 3\\
		5 & 1, 5 & 2 \\
		6 & 1, 2, 3, 6 & 4 \\ 
		\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\
	\end{array}
\]
(b) Create a ``grid'' chart of factors.  Label the horizontal and vertical axes \(1\) through \(20\).  For each number on the horizontal axis, fill in the square corresponding to each of its factors in the vertical direction.  
\\ 
(c) What patterns do you observe, and do you expect they continue?  What future paterns do you expect might arrise?

\subsection{GCF and LCM}

\begin{definition} [Greatest Common Factor]
The \emph{greatest common factor} (GCF) of two numbers is the largest factor they have in common.  

For example, The GCF of \(8\) and \(12\) is \(4\). The GCF of \(9\) and \(27\) is \(9\).  
\end{definition}


\begin{definition} [Least Common Multiple]
The \emph{least common multiple} (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest multiple they have in common.  

For example, the LCM of \(6\) and \(4\) is \(12\).  The LCM of \(8\) and \(24\) is \(24\).   
\end{definition}

\subsection{Fractions}
There are many ways to think about fractions: we can talk about fractions as part of a whole, or as a ratio, or rate, or as division.

A lot of concepts we'll work with revolve around \emph{equivalent fractions}, fractions that are equivalent!

% REDUCE 
\textbf{Reducing Fractions}
\\ \\ 
\emph{Reducing} is one of the most common tasks we'll see with fractions.  Reducing a fraction means to write a fraction in its lowest terms.

\newpage 
\textbf{Adding and Subtracting Fractions}
\\ \\
Adding fractions involves combining numerators.   The example below could be read as ``five eigths plus two eigths equals seven eigths''.  
\begin{example}
	Find the following sum:
	\[\frac{5}{8}+\frac{2}{8}\]
\textbf{Solution:}
	\[\frac{5}{8}+\frac{2}{8} = \frac{5+2}{8} =  \frac{7}{8}\]
\end{example}
Subtraction is similar. 
\begin{example}
	Find the following difference:
	\[\frac{5}{8}-\frac{2}{8}\]
\textbf{Solution:}
	\[\frac{5}{8}-\frac{2}{8} = \frac{5-2}{8} = \frac{3}{8}\]
\end{example}
Adding and subtracting fractions requires a common denominator.  For example, we cannot cannot directly add or subtract thirds with fifths.  However, we can convert fractions to equivalent fractions with common denominators.  
\begin{example}
	Find the following sum: 
	\[\frac{7}{3} + \frac{2}{5}\]
\textbf{Solution:}
	\[\frac{7}{3} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{35}{15} + \frac{14}{15} = \frac{49}{15} \]
\end{example}
To get a common denominator, you want to determine the smallest common multiple of your two denominators.  That is, the smallest number that is a multiple of both denominators.  In the example above, \(15\) is a multiple of both \(3\) and \(5\).  
\begin{remark}
 	When converting a fraction to an equivalent fraction, we can think of this manipulation as multiplying by \(1\).  For example, we coverted \(\frac{7}{3}\) to \(\frac{35}{15}\) by multiplying \(\frac{7}{3}\) by \(\frac{5}{5}\).  Importantly, \(\frac{5}{5} = 1\)  and multiplying by \(1\) does not change the \emph{value} of the original number. 
\end{remark}
