Find solutions to the following equation: 
\[ y+2x=12 \]
Find solutions to the following equation: 
\[ y=2x+4 \]
Each of the equations above has an infinite number of solutions, but there is exactly one solution that is true for both of them, and that is the solution to the \emph{system of equations}.  



What is a solution to a system of equations?
